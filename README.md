# UMass-Pages

This is a project for a web-programming course. It's aimed to allow users to add and find study spaces on campus based on time, location, and several other factors.
Most data is generated via faker.js as it is not a production-use project, and the building information was obtained via a web-scraper you can find [here](https://github.com/Snow-cannon/UMass-buildings-web-scraper.git) from [this site](https://www.umass.edu/mail/campus-building-addresses).

It is created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript and was deployed on heroku until heroku free dynamos were no longer available. It also uses postgreSQL, but the heroku database
is no longer available.
