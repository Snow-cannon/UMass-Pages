## Application Idea

One of the problems I have run into on campus is locating places to study. During my one year on campus, every study space I have used was either shown to me by someone who'd been on campus for a long time or was obvious such as the Student Union. It can be difficult to find places to study with friends if you are unsure what is open or closed. While wandering around can be fun it can also be time consuming, potentially keeping you from being able to study at all.

One way to fix this problem is to create a website that allows users to share their study spaces with the rest of the campus community. **UMass Spaces** will let users share study areas online, allowing other users to find great places to study. Users will be able to share study areas, search for new study areas based on specific criteria, and comment on the study areas for other people to read. This will help students find interesting locations while also shortening the amount of time needed to find them.
