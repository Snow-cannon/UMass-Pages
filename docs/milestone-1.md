## Application Idea

One of the problems I have run into on campus is locating places to study. During my one year on campus, every study space I have used was either shown to me by someone who'd been on campus for a long time or was obvious, such as the Student Union. It can be difficult to find places to study with friends if you are unsure what is open or closed. While wandering around can be fun it can also be time consuming, potentially keeping you from being able to study at all.

One way to fix this problem is to create a website that allows users to share their study spaces with the rest of the campus community. **UMass Spaces** will let users share study areas online, allowing other users to find great places to study in a short amount of time. Users will be able to share study areas, search for new study areas based on specific criteria, and comment on the study areas for other people to read. This will help students find interesting locations while also shortening the amount of time needed to find them.

Some inspiration from the example project idea [UMass Course Review](https://github.com/Anderson-100/cs326-project-undefined/blob/main/docs/milestone-1.md) by Anderson Hsiao, and from a constant annoyance at the lack of available group study spaces at UMass (The ones I know of are always full).

## Functionality

**UMass Spaces** will have a single page. The top will have a bar that, when clicked, opens a form that allows you to enter a new study area with all the associated information listed below. Underneath the bar is the search option. This will have another form that allows users to enter filters based on what they want in a study area. When they search it will show all the study areas that match those filters, creating a scrolling list underneath with the images and the descriptions of the associated areas. The user can then click on an area to see comments, write a comment, and see all associated information on that particular site to see if it's something they are interested in. I would like to add a 'search near me' option, but I believe that would be too difficult. If I have time, however, I might attempt it.

Data for each site:

* Image
* Description
* Number of seats
  * Multiple tables?
  * Seats per table?
<!-- * Schedule
  * Days
  * Times during each day
  * Classroom schedule? -->
* Location
  * Building
  * Room number
* Wall plug access (Laptops need charging)
  * Number of plugs?
<!-- * Restrictions
  * Specific building access
  * Grad student? -->
<!-- * Near food? ðŸ¤· (Might remove) -->
<!-- * Other filters as I think of them (Too many can make it clunky) -->
* Comments
